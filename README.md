# MoveTheBoxes
## This moves around the boxes and will answer you questions. Keep your question simple though.


### I was watching the 6.034 Artificial Intelligence by Patrick Winston. 
### In one of his very first lectures, he explained a simple but very effective model which can moves
### boxes around as instructed through stacks of boxes and will also reason why it did move the boxes
### around the way it did when asked with a 'Why' or 'How' question such as 'Why did you move the Box2?'
### or 'How to place Box1 on top of Box2?'
